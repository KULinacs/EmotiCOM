# EmotiCOM
An Android and iPhone app designed to showcase technology's growing ability to determine the mood of its user. Built using Phonegap, EmotiCOM utilizes the IBM Watson for tone analysis of text and the Microsoft Oxford API for face analysis. Upon determining the mood of the user, the interface is changed and music that suits the user is pulled from SoundCloud.

NOTE: API keys must be added for the app to run.

Built for HackUTD 2016
